## Planning
To plan this project, we first created we created [User Stores](https://github.com/cse110-sp24-group15/cse110-sp24-group15/blob/main/specs/users/user_stories.md) and User Personas to get inspiration for this project. We used a a ***behavior driven development*** process and brainstormed different features based on the stories and personas.

We then utilzed a [Miro Board](https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/R1M1QmxZVU5VOFZmY092MDJpbEtNVENmWk9ZYlhNZlJTMzFsOEVuTXRSM1F5a3JkMkpQMWMyblFRSjgxcHJGM3wzNDU4NzY0NTg3MTcwNTgyOTIyfDI=?share_link_id=179656458973) to visualize our design.
This board contains the following information:
- Design outline for each page in the form of a diagram
- Timeline for the project in sticky notes below the diagram
- 2 user personas to help motivate the design

## CI/CD Pipeline
Every Feature was assigned an issues which used [Template](https://github.com/cse110-sp24-group15/cse110-sp24-group15/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-page.md). For each Issue, a Pull Request was made. For Continous Integration, the following checks were run
- Superlinting for CSS, HTML and Javascript
- Codacy Code Quality Check, click here for results [Codacy Dashboard](https://app.codacy.com/gh/cse110-sp24-group15/cse110-sp24-group15/dashboard)
- Node.js testing on versions `16.x` and `18.x`

Once all the checks passed, a manual review was held to check code quality. Once ***1 review*** was approved, the PR was merged with `main` and the Continous Development was run:
- JSDoc Generation
- Github Pages Deployment

## Testing
For the developer journel we emplyed two forms of testing
1.  Unit testing for each page's javascript which can be found in the following format `project/tests/PAGENAME.tests.js`
2.  End to End Pupeteer Testing which can be found in the following format `project/tests/PAGENAME.tests.js`

## Backlog
To keep track of our backlog, we used github project. This is a link to our [backlog system](https://github.com/orgs/cse110-sp24-group15/projects/1)

## Documentation
For Documentation, we autogenerated it using JSDocs. Here is the link to our code documentation: [JSDocs](https://cse110-sp24-group15.github.io/cse110-sp24-group15/docs/jsdoc/index.html)
