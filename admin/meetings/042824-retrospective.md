Recap:
- Each of us filled out the retrospective form
- We went over the form: 
  - Some of us didn’t feel engaged enough because it’s a small assignment. We will assign issues to everyone individually to have evenly distributed work loads. 
  - Github issues: check box worked great
  - Workflow: everyone will not work on the same file, branches should be created properly
  - In-person meeting: 2-3pm every Thursday. Additional meetings in sub-teams
  - Deadline: works should be done a day before deadline
