Notes:

We split the larger teams into subteams: Front End and Backed. We went over developer workflows:

Master branch: our deployed main app
Dev Branch: To test whether all our fixes work
Each feature will be a new branch: for example Front_End/add_home_page
To merge Front_end to dev, we will have a review from one of the leads
To Merge with Master, everyone will submit a review of the code

All features need to have tests
All code need to have commenting

Github actions will be added to automatically prereview code
