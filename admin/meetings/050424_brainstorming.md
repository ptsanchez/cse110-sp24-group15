Notes
- Advaith: Miro board presentation
    - Journal has homepage, archived pages, active pages, monthly weekly daily view, feedback, add log page

    - Suggestions: 
        - work with a simple base journal.
	        - once base is made work on extra “wow” factor
        - on daily page add checklist for progress.
	    - add a progress bar on homepage
	    - add login feature
		    - (later on) after login is created, make a collaboration feature
	    - add a “joke” feature that changes joke with every refresh

- Jaewon idea: implement chatgpt api so when a question is asked in checklist on the daily page chatgpt will give a response.
	- also add a comment/chat function
