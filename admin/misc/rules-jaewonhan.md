# Project Etiquette and Team Interaction Guidelines

Welcome to Team Jover! To ensure smooth progress and a supportive work environment, we've established some basic etiquette and rules. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with these guidelines.

## Communication

### Regular Updates 
- **Weekly Schedule**: Weekly team meeting in Giesel from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm on Thursdays.
- **Weekly Stand-ups**: Each team member should provide updates on their progress, plans for the week, and any blockers they are facing.
- **Weekly Meetings**: We will hold a weekly meeting to discuss more extensive progress, upcoming deadlines, and any critical issues.

### Respectful Communication
- Always be respectful in your interactions, regardless of the medium (chat, email, face-to-face).
- Use clear and concise language to avoid misunderstandings.

## Code Management

### Version Control
- **Branches**: Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- **Commits**: Write meaningful commit messages that clearly explain the changes made.
- **Pull Requests**: Use pull requests for merging code. **Advaith Ravishankar** will review all code before it is merged.

### Code Reviews
- Approach code reviews with a constructive attitude. Focus on improving the code and not critiquing the coder.
- Be open to receiving feedback and willing to make necessary changes.

## Workspace

### Shared Resources
- Keep shared resources (e.g., databases, testing environments) in good working order. Communicate with the team before making changes that could affect others.

### Clean Code Practices
- Follow the projectâ€™s coding standards and guidelines.
- Ensure your code is well-documented and easy to understand.

## Conflict Resolution

- Address conflicts directly and respectfully with the involved parties.
- Seek to understand different perspectives and work towards a solution that benefits the project.
- If needed, involve a neutral third party (e.g., project supervisor) to mediate.

## Recognition and Appreciation

- Acknowledge the efforts of your teammates. A simple "thank you" can go a long way.
- Celebrate milestones and successes together as a team.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can foster a positive and productive environment that benefits both the project and our personal growth as team members. Let's work together to make this project a success!
