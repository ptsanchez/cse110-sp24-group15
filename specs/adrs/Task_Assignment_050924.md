# Task Assignment Brainstorming

## Context and Problem Statement

We have an assigned team, and we need to figure out how we will work on future tasks/actions as a group, and keep in mind people's busy schedules.

## Considered Options

1. Developers will be issued only one issue at a time and work in close-knit groups of 1-2 members
2. Developers will be issued several issues simultaneously and can choose which issues to work on, and will work in larger groups of 3-4 members
3. Each member will work on a specific file only to avoid merge conflicts. Once a certain action is resolved, team leads will take care of reviews and merging
4. In case of a situation where a teammate is unable to work due to some unforeseen circumstances, Advaith will take care of reassigning work

## Decision Outcome

1. Developers work on one issue only at a time - This is a good idea as developers can focus on a specific issue at a time, and concentrate their energy on it

3. Developers will work on one issue at a time - To avoid confusion and merge conflicts that may arise as a result of multiple file-edits, this is a good idea

4. Work reassignment - Work should be reassigned in case someone has certain commitments and is unable to deliver so that the team as a whole can still progress on work

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Good, as the team is working on multiple issues simultaneously and making it easier to deal with merge conflicts, in any case in which they arise
* Good, as the team management strategy makes it possible for the reshuffling/redistribution of work in special cases
* Bad, as the above point may result on an excessive amount of work being concentrated in the hands of fewer people
* Bad, as working on one file may not be desirable in certain circumstances(for example, when an error in a file is caused by a line/lines of code in another file, and causes delays in overall workflow)
