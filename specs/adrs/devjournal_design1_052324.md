# Dev Journal Design - GitHub Integration and Code Snippets

## Context and Problem Statement

We have started working on a baseline developer journal, and we wish to add-on and incorporate new features that may make the dev-journal nicer and more aesthetic to use.

## Decision Drivers

1. Since GitHub is used so extensively by Developers, it would only be fair for a Developer Journal to provide some sort of GitHub Integration, or basic code support to make the developer journal more useful from the developer's perspective.

## Considered Options

1. Extensive Github Integration through task pages(mainly day page), so as to be able to navigate those specific tasks via GitHub

2. Provide an option for a small Code Snippet page associated with a task, so as to help the developer remember/refresh their ideas on a particular task.


## Decision Outcome

GitHub Integration and Code Snippets - The team thinks that this is a good idea, as concluded on Thursday's sprint meeting! We need a wak for developers to directly go to the task at hand, rather than just see the task. This can be done by having a small GitHub integration as a part of the dev journal!

Additionally, we decided that developers can include a small code snippet, if they wish to.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Good, as this makes the journal more useful and practical from a dev's perspective
* Bad, as it may further complicate the website from the dev's perspective, and the goal is to not have an overcomplicated note taking website like Notion. 
* Bad, as it might complicate the Developer Journal design process for the team and would mean significant modifications and deviations from the original Miro Board concept.

## Validation

Once implemented, we can have a GitHub branch with this feature implemented. If this improves or enhances the website, then we can incorporate this idea as a part of the main branch later.

## More Information

As of now, this is not a matter of urgency. Most developers need to work on the current design as per the Miro Board, and write relevant unit tests. This can be implemented as an additional feature later once the other basic tasks are done.
