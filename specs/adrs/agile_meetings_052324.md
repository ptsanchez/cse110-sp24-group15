# Agile Meetings Discussion

## Context and Problem Statement

Our team has gotten to know each other, and we have started making progress towards making the developer journal. We need to keep up the work with an agile-mechanism for team meetings and reviews to ensure increased teamwork, awareness, and progress towards the developer journal.

## Decision Drivers

1. Desired option should maximize productivity, overall team-awareness, and should try to maximize individual team-member contribution through participation in meetings

## Considered Options

1. We will have sprint-reviews and daily stand-ups in-line with existing Agile methods.

2. We will not consider daily stand-ups, as it may happen on occasions that people are unable to turn-in work, making stand-ups awkward for some people.

3. Sprint-reviews will happen in a hybrid-mode to account for emergencies and rare occasions(with the expectation that a significant majority of people attend the sprint meetings), and stand-ups will happen on the Slack Channel.

4. Sprint reviews will be fully-remote to account for personal schedules, and stand-ups will happen at a pre-decided time via Zoom.


## Decision Outcome

Daily stand-ups and weekly sprint reviews - We will have weekly sprint reviews on Thursday, 2PM at Geisel Library with a remote Zoom option for people with exceptional circumstances causing them not to attend. Stand-ups will happen on a daily basis via a separate slack channel 'daily-standup', as it is hard to find a Zoom time on a daily-basis for Stand-ups. Having a Slack channel helps keep people updated without compromising on their availability for other tasks.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Good, as this is in-line with proven Agile practice, and is a very strucutred way of working on a large, scalable project like Developer Journal.
* Bad, as having a hybrid meeting option may incentivize people to skip in-person meetings, even though having a Zoom meeting is just geared/intended towards people with exceptional circumstances. Additionally, some people may not report their daily-standup in case they did nothing out of fear of embarassment, making the slack channel relatively empty and unhelpful.

## Validation

We can take a look at sprint-review and stand-up participation to evaluate whether overall participation seems to be on the higher side.

## More Information

1. Sprint Review Attendance for Thursday, 23rd May: 9/10
2. Daily Stand-ups: People are yet to participate, as of 25th May
